# PayrollManagementSystem

## Just saw your feedback in checkin 1, really sorry about the empty repo. I believe there was a synchronization issue because I use 2 accounts but still don't know what really happened. I have deleted that repo and pushing checkin 1 content in this. Moving forward I will use this repo only. Thanks and accept my apologies.

### The Payroll Management System is a robust web application designed to streamline the process of managing employee records and payroll calculations. This comprehensive system offers features for adding, updating, and deleting employee details, creating payrolls and managing users.
